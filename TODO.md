# TODO

- Hashes in db should be stored as `:db.type/bytes` instead of `:db.type/string`.
- Import full blockchain and perf-tweak it.
  - Immediate goal here is to provide a simple way for people to host a fully-indexed blockchain locally.
- ^ Expose db with http api so that hyzhenhok can be integrated into other tools.
- Add search to explorer.
